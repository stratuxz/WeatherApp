# WeatherApp

# Created using python and its libraries such as: tkinter, requests, and time.
# The API from openweatherapp was used and tested using postman.

# This simple application lets you type in a city name and in return informs the user of today's
# weather. Information such as current temperature, max and min temperature, pressure, humitdity, wind, sunrise and sunset time
# are displayed. 

# This piece of code was inspired and followed from a youtube tutorial to develop knowledge of integrating an API to an
# application using the language I want to further advance in and to further understand the backend functionality of 
# information displayed.
