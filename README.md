# WeatherApp

Created using python and its libraries such as: tkinter, requests, and time. The API from openweatherapp was used and tested using postman.

This simple application lets you type in a city name and in return informs the user of today's weather. Information such as current temperature, max and min temperature, pressure, humitdity, wind, sunrise and sunset time are displayed. 

This piece of code was inspired and followed from a youtube tutorial to develop knowledge of integrating an API to an application using the language I want to further advance in and to further understand the backend functionality of information displayed.
